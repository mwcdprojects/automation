### ApiHelper

* This class will access the API and prints the character name , height and gender to a file.
* It has two methods : star_wars_characters returns the list and append_to_file method writes the content to a text file.
* There is also a unittest class that executes the apihelper class and validates if the returned data is non-empty or not.

## Steps to Execute:
* Git clone the folder "apitest"(Python package) from the repo.
* Execute the python file apihelper_unittest.py (This calls the python file apihelper.py which returns the relevant data and prints data to a text file.)

### PyPI packages 
* pip install requests
* pip install unittest
